## Project Summary
The `iTunes Search API App` is a GUI Application built in JavaFX, which displays a gallery of 20 artwork images based on the search query results of the iTunes Sarch API. When the application starts up, an initial set of images is displayed, corresponding to a provided default query. However, if the user would like a set of images relevant to a praticular query, then they may enter that query on the provided text field and click the `Update Images` Button. Additionally, a play and pause mode is integrated into the app
